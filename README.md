Conway's Game of Life as an automated composition mapped onto a Tonnetz

Required: Python3, music21 (available at http://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/usersGuide/usersGuide_01_installing.html)
(music21 can also be installed using pip)

A Tonnetz is a two-dimensional layout of musical notes, see here for more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonnetz

Conway's Game of Life is an experiment of cellular autonomation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

This script places musical notes on each point of the coordinate plane. All living cells will be played as their respective musical notes. Each generation lasts for one measure. You can choose to have each generation be a chord, or a melody, or both, and you can change the instrument given. If you choose melody, the speed of the melody depends on the number of generation, which often creates complex and interesting rhythms. 

An audio example (melody only) can be found at https://soundcloud.com/danieltompkins/200-generations
